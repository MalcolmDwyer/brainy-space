# Brainy.Space flashcard component

This is a rebuild of part of my educational web app at [https://brainy.space](https://brainy.space)

The original was built with an early version of React and a very early version of Redux (2015).

This codebase is rebuilt with modern React, Vite for app construction, and Recoil for state management (2023).

Try it out with:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

Things you can do:

- Click a row or column header to filter to that
- Win the board and celebrate with an emoji party
- No timers... I got lots of feedback from my kids' classmates that they
  really liked that it had no timers to stress them out.

Note that this repo does not currently include the top menu or the multiple versions of the flashcards that appear on the main site. For now, it's just the 12x12 multiplication flashcards only.
